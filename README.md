I“The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful.” — Henri Poincaré

There are countless examples in nature that can be described through mathematics — from the structure of snowflakes, to the fractal geometry of Romanesco broccoli, to the self-similar patterns that guide how plants grow.

R is often viewed as a tool for serious analysis, but sometimes it’s just as enjoyable to use it for play — to explore patterns, experiment creatively, and turn math into art.

In this project, I used R’s graphical power to generate artistic floral patterns inspired by phyllotaxis, the natural arrangement of leaves and seeds in many plants. You don’t need a deep math background to enjoy it — just curiosity and a love for beautiful patterns in nature.
